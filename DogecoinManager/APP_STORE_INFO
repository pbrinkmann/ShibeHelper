Description
===========

Shibe Helper is a utility to help you on your Dogecoin mining journey (to the moon?).  It comes with three helpful utilities:

* Wallet Viewer - check your Dogecoin wallet balance and the value in USD
* Mining Pool Viewer - track your mining progress at your favorite mining pool (MPOS pools only)
* Mining Calculator - calculate Dogecoin profits based on your hashrate, power costs, etc.

Displayed mining pool info includes:

+ Your balance
+ Your hashrate
+ Pool progress on the next block
+ Your estimated payout when the block is found
+ Some stats on the previous block
+ ... and more!

*Please note* only MPOS-based pools that have the API enabled are supported for now

Unfortunately, the following popular pools have disabled the API and WILL NOT WORK with the app at release time:

- dogehouse.org
- fast-pool.com
- doge.netcodepool.org

++++++
This app relies on 3rd party data sources, so the availability of all features is not guaranteed

Howdy,

Thanks for helping test Shibe Helper - A Dogecoin mining helper!

I'm mainly concerned about UI elements being out of place and scrolling not working on iPhone 4/4S devices.

If you want some free dogecoin (and to test the wallet functionality), the easiest thing to do is sign up for an online wallet at:

https://www.dogevault.com/

Then log in, and:

Receive Dogecoin => New Address => OK => Actions => QR Code

scan that to load the wallet address.

Let me know what the address is and I'll send some dogecoins your way for you to use (or lose: http://dogesp.in/ or https://doge-dice.com/â€Ž)

-Paul
