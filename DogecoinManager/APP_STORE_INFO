Howdy,

Thanks for helping test Shibe Helper - A Dogecoin mining helper!

I'm mainly concerned about UI elements being out of place and scrolling not working on iPhone 4/4S devices.

If you want some free dogecoin (and to test the wallet functionality), the easiest thing to do is sign up for an online wallet at:

https://www.dogevault.com/

Then log in, and:

Receive Dogecoin => New Address => OK => Actions => QR Code

scan that to load the wallet address.

Let me know what the address is and I'll send some dogecoins your way for you to use (or lose: http://dogesp.in/ or https://doge-dice.com/â€Ž)

-Paul
