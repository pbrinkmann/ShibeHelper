[ ] Test on actual iPhone 4/4S screen


DONE!
[X] display DOGE => USD
[X] Add mining pool "last updated" string
[X] Fix issue with wallet QR code instructions not displaying
[X] Wallet and mining pool icons are pixellated :(
[X] On cancel from wallet address edit, don't do update
[X] Edit mining pool doesn't fill in pool URL and key, if previously scanned
[X] Edit mining pool will probably also do update on cancel, once pre-fill previous values works
[X] Review license for dogecoin images - license on github says do whatever you want :)
[X] Refresh indicator for wallet update
[X] Refresh indicator for mining pool update
[X] On first run, fields show a bunch of nulls and NaNs
[X] Error handling when wallet update fails
[X] Wallet address validation (# characters, starts with D, limited character set)
[X] Add dismiss keyboard logic from EditMiningPoolViewController to EditWalletAddress
[X] Replace pool hashrate with last block info - finder, time, amount
[X] Make the mining pool screen more attractive
[X] Retry API calls that fail
[X] dynamically calculate avg block reward (for mining pool)
[X] Get working on iPhone 4/4S 3.5" display - this is MANDATORY!
[X] save all values for both wallet and mining pool, so when starting up app you don't have blank values
[X] cache last block info (only refresh initially and if poolstatusinfo block # changes)
[X] bug: Wallet address doesn't save
[X] Error handling when mining pool update fails
[X] bug:Initial load of mining pool without having saved values to load results in NaN% and other ugliness
[X] No validation on mining pool entries (just need basics - both URL and API KEY and not empty string)
[X] Review license for both thirdparty libraries
[X] test on top 15 MPOS pools - maybe issue warnings if any of them specifically don't support the API?
  [:(] https://dogehouse.org/ - no api available, has 501 error
  [:(] https://fast-pool.com/ - no api available, has 501 error
  [X] https://doge.hashfaster.com/
  [X] https://doge.nut2pools.com/
  [X] https://www.suchcoins.com/ 
  [X] https://pool.dogechain.info/
  [x] https://teamdoge.com/ - no QR code, but manual entry works
  [:(] https://doge.netcodepool.org/ - no api available, has 501 error
  [?] http://doge.poolerino.com/ - doge pool was down during testing
  [X] https://doge.rapidhash.net/
  [X] http://doge.dedicatedpool.com/
  [X] https://doge.cryptoculture.net/  CHECK FOR DOGECOINS!!!!!! WAS MINING HERE ALL NIGHT
  [:(] https://www.shibepool.com/ - no api available, has 501 error
  [:|] https://pool.chunky.ms/ - has special URL for API, no QR code - https://pool.chunky.ms/doge/index.php?page=api&action=public
  [!$?!%?@%@] https://doge.pool.pm/ - has QR code, but it sets HTTP://, API only works on httpS://
[X] If dogeapi returns 0 for DOGE => USD conversion, don't show USD amount
[X] Add "new block!" overlay that fades out if the existing block doesn't match the current one
[X] FUCK - I can have either: custom view to display New Block!, OR: scrollable view.. WTF FUCK FUCK WTF this is retarded
[X] Make wallet address copyable (or copy when it's touched) on wallet balance screen
[X] trim whitespace on all mining pool text fields (wallet address already errors on invalid characters)
[X] relocate "refresh" button for mining pool - it's too easy to hit the wallet nav button instead
    - Traditionally, it's the circular arrow icon somewhere, OR the "pull to refresh" shit
[X] Add URL validation to edit mining pool after user changes URL. 
    Do a HEAD request to the public API (no token required), and report on:
        * 501 Not implemented - report probably not supported
        * 404 - check path?
        * anything else - invalid website?
[X] bugfix: Mining pool layout gets screwed up after returning from edit screen
[X] Replace NSLogs with something that doesn't spam in production
[X] in the wallet address copy popup, the bottom of the P in coPied is cut off

[X] Do whatever steps are necessary to produce production bundle
[X] Screenshots for App Store
[X] Write description for App Store,
    include mention that the following popular pools are NOT supported:
        * dogehouse.org 
        * fast-pool.com
        * doge.netcodepool.org
        * www.shibepool.com
[X] with a 0 DOGE balance address, USD can show up as (($0.00))
[X] Fuck me, we're doing a mining calculator :(  Get initial version working
[X] Keyboard close on mining calc screen
[X] wallet address edit done keyboard key does not close keyboard
[X] mining pool edit API done keyboard key does not close keyboard
[X] Recalc mining calc automatically once all values filled in
----- version 0.1 released

[X] Time to break even for mining calc
[X] Align "last updated" strings to be at the bottom of the screen,
    and exactly the same place on both wallet and mining pool screens
[X] Launch image for iPhone 4/4S
[X] Save/load previous mining calc values

----- version 0.11 IN PROGRESS



Rejected
========
[-] swipe right/left to transition between wallet and mining pool screens (animated).  It looks like this would be more trouble than it's worth :(
[-] Try and get rid of all compiler warnings - hmmm... it doesn't like my storyboard constraints, BUT, if I change them, shit gets fucked up.
